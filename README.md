# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio!

Hello! 

I'm Mariam, a passionate Web and UI Designer with a keen interest in creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly designs. I hold a degree in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security, and a certificate in UI/UX design, where I developed a strong foundation in web development and design, both server-side and front-end.

# What You’ll Find Here
In this portfolio, you’ll find a collection of my projects, ranging from dynamic web applications to sleek UI designs. Each repository includes detailed documentation, code samples, and insights into the development process, showcasing my expertise in:

PHP: Server-side scripting and web development.

Java: Object-oriented programming and application development.

Figma: Prototyping and UI/UX design.

HTML: Structuring web content.

CSS: Styling and layout design.

MySQL: Database design and management.

# Featured Projects
## Task Management Web Application
One of the projects is a Task Management Web Application. This application allows users to:

Login: Secure user authentication.

Add Tasks: Create new tasks with ease.

Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks as needed.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

I implemented a MySQL database to store both login information and the task list, ensuring that user data is saved and securely managed. This project showcases my ability to integrate front-end design with back-end functionality, creating a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Skincare Website Wireframe and Prototype
Another project is a wireframe and prototype for a Skincare Website. This project illustrates the process of selecting a product and checking out as a guest, demonstrating the user journey from product selection to purchase. The wireframe highlights a clean, user-friendly design, while the prototype brings the user experience to life.

## QR Code Safety Mobile Application
Another notable project I’m particularly proud of is a mobile application that allows users to scan a QR code and receive information on whether the QR code is safe or not. This application leverages my background in cyber security to provide a secure and user-friendly tool for verifying QR codes, ensuring users can navigate digital spaces safely.
