# What You’ll Find Here
In this portfolio, you’ll find a collection of my projects, ranging from dynamic web applications to sleek UI designs. Each repository includes detailed documentation, code samples, and insights into the development process, showcasing my expertise in:

PHP: Server-side scripting and web development.

Java: Object-oriented programming and application development.

Figma: Prototyping and UI/UX design.

HTML: Structuring web content.

# Featured Projects
## Task Management Web Application
One of the projects is a Task Management Web Application. This application allows users to:

Login: Secure user authentication.

Add Tasks: Create new tasks with ease.

Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks as needed.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

I implemented a MySQL database to store both login information and the task list, ensuring that user data is saved and securely managed. This project showcases my ability to integrate front-end design with back-end functionality, creating a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Skincare Website Wireframe and Prototype
Another project is a wireframe and prototype for a Skincare Website. This project illustrates the process of selecting a product and checking out as a guest, demonstrating the user journey from product selection to purchase. The wireframe highlights a clean, user-friendly design, while the prototype brings the user experience to life.

## Mobile Version for Car Rental Website
Additionally, I developed a wireframe and prototype for the mobile version of an existing Car Rental Website. This project focuses on optimizing the user experience for mobile devices, ensuring that users can easily browse available cars, make reservations, and manage their bookings on the go.

## QR Code Safety Mobile Application
Another notable project I’m particularly proud of is a mobile application that allows users to scan a QR code and receive information on whether the QR code is safe or not. This application leverages my background in cyber security to provide a secure and user-friendly tool for verifying QR codes, ensuring users can navigate digital spaces safely.
